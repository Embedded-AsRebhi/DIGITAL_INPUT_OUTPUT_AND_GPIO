# DIGITAL_INPUT_OUTPUT_AND_GPIO
During this exercise, we will need to write a program which inputs the status of the joystick on the application board, and  outputs them to the LEDs on the mbed LPC1768 board. We will learn in practice how to configure a General  Purpose Input Output (GPIO) peripheral at the register-level (low-level).
